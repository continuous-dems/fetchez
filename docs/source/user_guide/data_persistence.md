# 🔱 Disclaimer on Data Persistence

We provide the tools to locate and download data from authoritative public repositories, but we do not host the data ourselves.

Government agencies reorganize websites, migrate APIs (e.g., WCS 1.0 to 2.0), or decommission servers without notice. A module that fetches perfectly today may encounter a 404 tomorrow.

Source datasets are frequently updated, reprocessed, or removed by their custodians. The "best available" data for a region can change overnight.

Remote servers (like NOAA NCEI, USGS, or Copernicus) may experience downtime, throttling, or rate limits that are entirely outside our control.

We strive to keep our modules robust and our index fresh. If you encounter a broken fetch or a changed endpoint, please open an issue. This helps the whole community keep up with the changes!
